# **Setting Up Azure Blob Storage for Power Apps**  
I recently configured **Azure Blob Storage** for a Power Apps application, and I documented the steps to make it easier for future setups. Hereâ€™s my process:

## **Step 1: Creating the Azure Blob Storage Account**  
1. I logged into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).  
2. Clicked **Create a resource** > **Storage account**.  
3. Selected **Storage account â€“ blob, file, table, queue**.  
4. Configured the following:  
   - **Subscription**: Picked my Azure subscription.  
   - **Resource group**: Created a new one for better organization.  
   - **Storage account name**: Chose a unique name for easy identification.  
   - **Region**: Selected the most optimal location.  
   - **Performance**: Opted for **Standard** since high-speed access wasnâ€™t a priority.  
   - **Replication**: Used **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)** for cost efficiency.  
5. Clicked **Review + Create**, then **Create** to deploy the storage account.  

## **Step 2: Creating a Blob Container**  
1. Navigated to the **Storage Account** I just created.  
2. Opened the **Containers** section.  
3. Clicked **+ Container**, entered a container name, and set the **Public access level** (initially private).  
4. Clicked **Create** to finalize the setup.

## **Step 3: Retrieving Access Keys**  
1. Went to **Security + networking** > **Access keys**.  
2. Copied the **Storage account name** and **Key**, which were needed for Power Apps integration.

## **Step 4: Connecting Blob Storage to Power Apps**  
1. Opened **Power Apps** and went to **Data** > **Connections**.  
2. Clicked **New connection** > **Azure Blob Storage**.  
3. Entered the **Storage account name** and **Access key** from the previous step.  
4. Clicked **Create**, successfully integrating Azure Blob Storage into Power Apps.

## **Challenges I Faced & How I Fixed Them**  
Initially, after creating the blob container and sharing the **key, client ID, and necessary credentials** with the Power Apps team, it didnâ€™t work. After troubleshooting with my colleague and consulting with my mentor, we discovered that:  
- The **Power Apps tenant** was different from the **Azure tenant**, causing authentication failures.  
- My blob container was set to **private**, blocking external access.  

### **Solution:**  
To resolve the issue, I changed the containerâ€™s **access settings from private to anonymous**, allowing **public access**. This enabled the Power Apps team to successfully retrieve data without authentication conflicts.

## **Step 5: What the Power Apps Team Did**  
Once the connection was set up, the Power Apps team implemented Blob Storage in their application:

1. **Created a Canvas App** in Power Apps.  
2. **Added the Azure Blob Storage connector** to retrieve files.  
3. Used a **Gallery** to display stored files with:  
   ```  
   AzureBlobStorage.ListRootFolderV2().value  
   ```  
4. Added an **Upload Button** to enable file uploads:  
   ```  
   AzureBlobStorage.CreateFile("ContainerName", TextInput.Text, AddMediaButton.Media)  
   ```  
5. **Tested the setup**, verifying that Power Apps could interact with stored blobs correctly.

## **Key Takeaways & Best Practices**  
While switching to **anonymous access** fixed the issue, it **exposes storage publicly**, which can be a security risk. A better approach is:  
1. **Grant specific user permissions** via **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.  
2. **Use Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** instead of full access keys.  
3. **Ensure tenant alignment** between Azure and Power Apps to avoid authentication failures.  

Iâ€™ll apply these secure access methods in future projects to ensure data protection. If youâ€™re working on something similar and need assistance, feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
